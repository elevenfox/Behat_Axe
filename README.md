Behat Axe: An automated Testing System
=============

This system is based on PHP Behat + Mink framework, using selenium 3 for "Browser Testing" (mainly test JS).

Use it locally
----------------------

1.  Checkout latest codebase from Github

2.  Please copy `behat-template.yml` to `behat.yml`, and edit it: please change www.google.com to your domain in `local` section
  
  ```shell
  cp behat-template.yml behat.yml
  vi behat.yml
  ```
3.  Run `start.sh` to start automated-testing locally

  ```shell
  ./start.sh
  ```
4. If you have web-server(apache/nginx) installed on the same server, please point (vhost) DOCUMENT_ROOT to axe_admin, then you can use the web-based user interface to edit feature files.  
  
### Note: ### 
- start.sh is for both Mac OS and Linux, but thereâ€™s no start.bat for windows yet
- If you correctly setup step 4, you can use `http://127.0.0.1/` to edit test-cases 
- The first parameter of `start.sh` is to test a single scenario. It's the filename plus the line number of the scenario, for example: 
  ```shell
  ./start.sh ./features/anonymousVisits.feature:27
  ```
  
Directories and Files
----------------------

1.  `composer.json` is the composer dependency config file which will be used in step 2.


2.  `bin` and `vendor` folders are PHP Behat framework files which downloaded via composer based on compose.json

  ```shell
  composer install
  ```
  
3.  `behat.yml` is the main config for Behat framework, it can be generated by

  ```shell
  ./bin/behat --init
  ```
  
4.  `features` folder are all test cases written by Gherkin and test-step-scripts written by PHP

5.  `selenium` is for selenium 3 jar file and web drivers which are used to operate browers

  ```shell
  java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.1.0.jar
  ```
  
6.  `axe_admin` is a web-based test cases management tool (need to setup apache/nginx to use this)
